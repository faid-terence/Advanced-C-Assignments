The First Integer represents the starting time(hour) and the second integer represents the ending time(hour).Decimal numbers are not accepted 
The starting time will always be less than the ending time . Also no rental can span more than a day . The start time will be between 0 and 23 and the ending time will be between 1 and 24.
The rate per hour depends on the range as follows: 
0-7 and 21-24 : The rent will be 500 rwf per hour
7-14 and 19h-21h: Rent will be 1000 per hour
14-19: the rent will be 1500 per hour
